# TODO: Implement the main M2M (Model-to-Model) pipeline for the 
#       "Security Control Bypass Simulation" experiment.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. The pipeline must run a 3-stage LLM chain:
#       Stage A → Summary / Interpretation
#       Stage B → Classification / Risk Scoring
#       Stage C → Final Decision (alert / ignore / escalate)
#
# 2. Use the ModelClient class from models_client.py:
#       - call_model_a(text) -> str
#       - call_model_b(text) -> str
#       - call_model_c(text) -> str
#
# 3. Implement a function:
#       run_pipeline(raw_input: str) -> dict
#    It should:
#       - Call Model A with raw_input
#       - Call Model B with the output of Model A
#       - Call Model C with the output of Model B
#       - Return a dictionary containing:
#           {
#             "input": raw_input,
#             "stage_a_summary": "...",
#             "stage_b_classification": "...",
#             "stage_c_decision": "..."
#           }
#
# 4. Add a helper function:
#       pretty_print(result: dict) -> None
#    It should print the pipeline output in a readable format.
#
# 5. Add a small `if __name__ == "__main__":` block that:
#       - Defines 2–3 test input strings (safe ambiguous user actions)
#       - Runs the pipeline on each input
#       - Prints the output using pretty_print()
#
# 6. All comments and docstrings must be written in English.
# 7. Temperature must remain deterministic (0.2 is fine).
# 8. Do not include any harmful or exploit-generating prompts.
